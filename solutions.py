# My limitations in guaranteeing the worst-case O(N) time complexity:

# DO:

# Use single-pass loops (O(N)).
# Use hash maps or sets if they improve lookup efficiency.
# Use linear-time sorting (if applicable, e.g., counting sort).

# AVOID:

# Nested loops that cause O(NÂ²) complexity.
# Sorting unless absolutely necessary (O(N log N)).
# Recursive solutions without memoization, as they might have exponential time complexity.
# Unoptimized hash table operations, which can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
